			<h2 style="text-align: center;">WELCOME TO OUR PAGE</h2>
			<p style="text-align: center;">The Hawksbill, Olive Ridley, Green, Leatherback, and Loggerhead sea turtles can be found in Sri Lanka. Both Sri Lanka's tourism sector and the health of the marine ecology depend on these turtles. Five of the world's seven sea turtle species, including the Green Turtle, Olive Ridley Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, and Loggerhead Turtle, are found in Sri Lanka.
        <p style="text-align: center;">The Olive Ridley and Leatherback turtles are the most endangered of these species, which are all classified as critically endangered or endangered. Sea turtle populations have been dropping as a result of habitat loss, poaching, and pollution, despite the fact that they are essential to sustaining the health of the ocean's ecosystems. There are various turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka that monitor nesting locations, gather and incubate eggs, and release hatchlings back into the water in order to safeguard these species.</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;">Monitoring turtle nests is a significant conservation endeavor that serves to save sea turtle populations all around the world. Researchers can better understand sea turtle behavior and population trends by observing nesting locations and gathering information on the quantity of nests, eggs, and hatchlings. Then, with the use of this knowledge, conservation efforts may be made to safeguard sea turtles from dangers like habitat loss, pollution, and poaching. Monitoring turtle nests is an essential component of sea turtle conservation and helps to ensure that these lovely animals will survive for many generations to come.

			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Egg Collection and Incubation</h2>

		<p style="text-align: center;">A crucial component of attempts to conserve sea turtles is the gathering and incubation of turtle eggs. Sea turtle eggs are still being taken for human consumption in many places, and this practice can have a serious impact on turtle populations. Conservationists have created initiatives to gather turtle eggs and incubate them in protected settings until they hatch in order to combat this.

      By doing this, the eggs are protected from being eaten by humans or other animals and have a higher probability of hatchling survival. The eggs are incubated in a controlled atmosphere to guarantee healthy development, and after hatching, the hatchlings are released into the ocean. </p>

			<p style="text-align: center;">The release of hatchling turtles is a crucial component of sea turtle conservation efforts. The young are carefully removed from the eggs when they have hatched and brought to the beach where they are released into the water. To give the hatchlings the best chance of surviving, this process is carefully observed.

        In order to ensure that the hatchlings may reach the ocean safely and have the best chance of survival, hatchling releases are an essential component in sea turtle conservation. Conservationists are ensuring that sea turtle stocks are safeguarded and that these gorgeous animals will flourish for many generations to come by releasing the hatchlings into the ocean.
